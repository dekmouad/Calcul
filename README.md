Calculator Project
This is a calculator application that allows users to perform Advanced arithmetic operations. The application is built using a layered architecture that separates the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer. The project was completed as part of an internship at KAZANCI HOLDING AKSA.

Features
The calculator application allows users to perform the following operations:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Modulus
log
sqrt
ln 
e 
sin / sinh
cos/cosh
tan/tanh
Dic/Bin/Hex/Oct
The application displays the result of the operation in a clear and easy-to-read format. and store results into a database.

Getting Started
To use the calculator application, simply clone the project from GitHub and run it on your local machine. The application was built using C# and Visual Studio, so you will need to have these tools installed on your machine. then add an Sql table called results with 4 raws (num1, opt, num2, result) and add connect your visual code to your local database to see the stored results.

Usage
To use the calculator application, simply enter two numbers and select the operation you would like to perform. The application will display the result of the operation in the output field.
